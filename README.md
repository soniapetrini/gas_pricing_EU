# Natural Gas Pricing Mechanisms in Europe
## from Oil-Indexation to Hub-Based

### Abstract
In this work, our aim is to assess the state of the evolution of natural gasâ€™ pricing mechanism across Europe. As the historical relation between natural gas and oil prices has begun to fade, it left room for a competitive hub-based pricing system, sensitive to actual market conditions. We extend previous research on this topic to the 2014-2020 time span, first verifying that cointegration between oil and gas prices does not exist anymore, then exploring the new pricing mechanism through both regression and impulse response analysis, confirming that natural gas price is indeed responding to its market fundamentals.

### Analysis
